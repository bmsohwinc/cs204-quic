    <h1>Asyncio TLS HTTP Demo</h1>
    <p>
      This is a static HTML page served over a TCP connection wrapped with TLS using Python's asyncio module.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this page is simply to provide a body of text with a character count similar to a small example page.
      The content itself is not important, but we include enough text to make the payload non-trivial and realistic.
    </p>
    <h2>Demo information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The server listens on localhost using a self-signed certificate.</li>
      <li>The client connects with TLS enabled and sends a basic HTTP GET request.</li>
      <li>The server replies with this document and closes the connection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In a more advanced setting, you might extend this demo to support multiple routes, query parameters, and dynamic
      responses, but for now we are focusing on a very small and easy to understand example that is still large enough
      to mimic a realistic scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      This final paragraph only exists to pad the total number of characters in the HTML document so that it is closer
      in size to the reference page you provided earlier. It has no functional role in the client or server logic.
